UNIX
If you have PostgreSQL (>= 9.3) devel packages and CURL devel packages installed (>= 0.7.20), you should have pg_config and curl-config on your path, so you should be able to just run make (or gmake), then make install, then in your database CREATE EXTENSION http.

If you already installed a previous version and you just want to upgrade, then ALTER EXTENSION http UPDATE.


apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-all
make
make install

psql -d taxi2 -c "CREATE EXTENSION http;"
